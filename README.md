Just practicing git

Configure github:
	git config --global user.email "email.com"
	git config --global user.name "your name"

Confirm username and email:
	git config --global user.name
	git config --global user.email

Clone repo: 
git clone "link"

Add a file to be tracked:
git add filename
git add . 				tracks all files with changes

Remove a file to be tracked:
git remove filename

Check the status:
git status

Commit changes:
git commit -m "message for commit"

Upload changes:
git push

Download latest:
git pull

See all branches:
git branch

Create branch
git branch branch_name

Use branch
git checkout branch_name

create a ".gitignore" file to prevent uploading certain files, file types and folders




// ***************** TIPS ***************** //

a pull request can be made to update branch to master
pull request have to be approved by a merge pull request

bad practice to always work from master

branches are saved locally and synced with repo when a pull is done

always add a readme.md so people can see what the repo is for
